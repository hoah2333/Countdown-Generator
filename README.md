## Contributing

You can preview the output on your computer after you pulled the project.

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

This will open a real-time update website on your browser. You can modify the codes, and see the difference when you save the code.

After that, because the adapter of `dev` mode is different from `build` mode, you must build and see if there's any error on your code.

```bash
# build the generator
npm run build
# check the generator on your computer
npm run preview -- --open
```
